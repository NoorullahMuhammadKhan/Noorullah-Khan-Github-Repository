    "### Conclusion and Explanation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The Siamese Neural Network (SNN) implemented for this task aimed to classify question-answer pairs based on their relationship, using a TF-IDF vector representation with Euclidean-distance-based contrastive loss. Despite a structured approach in data preparation and model training, the results indicate several performance limitations, as reflected in both the training and failure case analysis outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Performance and Output Observations**:\n",
    "   - **Model Training**: The model’s training began with a moderate accuracy of approximately **53%** and fluctuated through the epochs. By the final epoch, the training accuracy reached **53.35%** with a validation accuracy of **52.73%**, showing minimal improvement over the training period. The validation loss stabilized around **0.6917**, which suggests that the model struggled to capture meaningful patterns within the data, plateauing early on.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation of Results**: The relatively low accuracy and stagnant validation metrics indicate that the model may not effectively differentiate between related and unrelated pairs, likely due to limitations in the TF-IDF and Euclidean-distance-based approach. Specifically, the use of TF-IDF vectors, which represent terms based on their frequency rather than contextual meaning, limited the model’s ability to understand nuanced relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Challenges and Model Limitations**:\n",
    "   - **TF-IDF Representation**: TF-IDF vectors provide a sparse representation focused on word frequency, which may be insufficient for capturing the contextual depth required for this task. This limitation likely contributed to the model’s inability to effectively separate related from unrelated pairs, especially in cases where the relationship is implied rather than explicit.\n",
    "   - **Euclidean Distance with Contrastive Loss**: Euclidean distance calculates a direct linear similarity, which works well in spatial data contexts but is less suitable for high-dimensional text vectors lacking semantic structure. This likely caused the model to misclassify pairs where the relationship relies on contextual understanding, leading to poor generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Failure Case Analysis**:\n",
    "   - The failure case analysis provided concrete examples of misclassifications, offering insight into specific limitations. Examples such as:\n",
    "     - **\"What are some tips for exercising to help with cancer-related fatigue\"** paired with **\"That's one of the most common side effects of the disease and treatments for it\"**.\n",
    "     - **\"How does hormone therapy cause breast cancer fatigue\"** paired with **\"Hormone therapy deprives the body of estrogen, and that can lead to fatigue that may last throughout your treatment or longer\"**.\n",
    "   - In each case, the model predicted the pairs as unrelated (label 0) when they were actually related (label 1). This misclassification points to the model’s struggle with pairs where the relationship depends on understanding context and indirect phrasing. TF-IDF’s lack of semantic understanding likely led the model to overlook these subtle connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implications and Potential Improvements**:\n",
    "   - **Enhanced Embeddings**: Replacing TF-IDF with word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or transformer-based models such as BERT could provide a more meaningful representation, as these models capture semantic relationships and context that TF-IDF does not.\n",
    "   - **Alternative Similarity Metrics**: Exploring alternative distance measures, such as cosine similarity, may better capture the relationships in high-dimensional space and offer improvements over Euclidean distance for this type of data.\n",
    "   - **Additional Training Data and Augmentation**: Expanding the dataset or augmenting it with similar examples could help the model generalize better, especially for question-answer pairs that have indirect phrasing or are complex in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summary**:\n",
    "   - The Siamese Neural Network with contrastive loss provided a foundational approach to relationship classification but struggled with the task’s nuanced requirements due to limited feature representation and distance measures. The consistent validation results across epochs indicate that while the model was able to recognize some basic patterns, it lacked the depth needed to accurately classify complex relationships. This implementation serves as a baseline for exploring improvements in model architecture and feature representation to enhance performance on relationship-based text classification tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. (1 mark) Each input for this model should be a concatenation of qtext and atext. Use [SEP] to separate qtext and atext, e.g., \"Can high blood pressure bring on heart failure? [SEP] Hypertensive heart disease is the No.\" You need to pad the input to a fixed length. How do you determine a suitable length?\n",
    "2. (1.5 marks) Choose a suitable tokenizer and justify your choice.\n",
    "3. (1 mark) An embedding layer that generates embedding vectors of the sentence text into size 128. Remember to add position embedding.\n",
    "4. (1 mark) One transformer encoder layer, you need to find a hidden dimension in {64, 128, 256}. Use 3 heads in MultiHeadAttention.\n",
    "5. (1 mark) Do we need a transformer decoder layer for this task? If yes, find a hidden dimension in {64, 128, 256} and use 3 heads in MultiHeadAttention. If no, explain why.\n",
    "6. (0.5 marks) 1 hidden layer with size 256 and ReLU activation function.\n",
    "7. (0.5 marks) 1 output layer with size 2 for binary classification to predict whether two inputs are related or not. \n",
    "8. (1 mark) Choose a suitable loss to train the model\n",
    "9. (1 mark) Report your best accuracy on the test split.\n",
    "10. (1.5 marks) Give an example of a failure case, and explain the possible reason and discuss a potential solution.\n",
    "11. (1 mark) Good coding style as explained in the above Assessment Section.\n",
    "12. (1 mark) Correctly feeding data into your model, and correctly training and testing of your models.\n",

    "### Conclusion and Explanation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer-based model implemented for the sentence-pair classification task demonstrated substantial success, achieving a final test accuracy of **80%**. Through carefully structured experimentation and analysis, the model configuration was refined to best address the task’s requirements, with each component of the model evaluated and adjusted for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Architecture and Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   The model leveraged a multi-head attention mechanism within a transformer encoder layer, alongside an embedding layer with positional encodings to handle token-level and positional relationships effectively. By experimenting with various hidden dimensions (64, 128, and 256), the model achieved the highest validation accuracy of **82%** with a hidden dimension of 128, which provided a balanced trade-off between representational capacity and generalization. Additionally, the use of a dense hidden layer with 256 units allowed the model to capture non-linear relationships, contributing to its classification performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Performance and Evaluation**:\n",
    "   During training, the model displayed steady improvements across epochs, with validation accuracy reaching a peak around **82%** and stabilizing at **80%** on the test set. This outcome suggests that the model generalized well to unseen data, effectively distinguishing between semantically related and unrelated question-answer pairs. However, certain patterns in validation loss and accuracy indicated areas where further refinement could enhance performance, particularly for more nuanced cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis of Failure Cases**:\n",
    "   A targeted analysis of failure cases highlighted specific limitations of the model, especially with question-answer pairs that contained ambiguous language, implied relationships, or complex medical and technical terminology. In these instances, the model tended to misclassify due to insufficient semantic understanding beyond the token level. This challenge is common in natural language processing tasks that require a deep, contextual comprehension of language, and it suggests that the current model’s approach may benefit from enhancements that enable richer semantic representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Potential Areas for Improvement**:\n",
    "   To address these limitations, several approaches could be explored:\n",
    "   - **Integration of Pre-trained Language Models**: Leveraging advanced language models such as BERT or RoBERTa, which are pre-trained on large text corpora, could improve the model’s ability to understand nuanced language and implicit relationships between sentences. These models offer a more comprehensive semantic framework that would likely improve accuracy on complex, nuanced cases.\n",
    "   - **Data Augmentation and Expansion**: Increasing the volume and diversity of training data, either through data augmentation techniques or by adding more labeled examples, could help the model generalize better, particularly for low-frequency patterns and rare word combinations that were challenging in the initial implementation.\n",
    "   - **Advanced Transformer Architectures**: Experimenting with additional transformer encoder layers or alternative architectures, such as multi-layer transformers, could provide the model with a greater depth of understanding and improve its handling of complex language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summary**:\n",
    "   In conclusion, the model demonstrated robust performance for the classification of sentence pairs, successfully identifying related pairs within the dataset. While its accuracy highlights the effectiveness of the transformer architecture for this task, further refinement—particularly in the areas of semantic comprehension and data diversity—could elevate performance in contexts involving nuanced or ambiguous language. This implementation provides a strong foundation and clear direction for future optimization, validating the transformer’s capacity for relational text classification tasks and its adaptability to more complex, contextually rich datasets.\n",

    "During the course of Assignment 3 Part 2, I occasionally encountered issues such as syntax errors, runtime errors, or uncertainties regarding the performance of my models. In these instances, I made use of AI tools, specifically GPT, to help me understand and resolve these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when encountering a `ValueError` related to incompatible shapes within the transformer model layers, GPT provided explanations and suggestions to align the expected input shapes, helping me adjust my code. Additionally, I used GPT to verify my understanding of how to handle errors in model configuration, such as determining compatible hidden dimensions for multi-head attention layers and resolving issues with positional encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to emphasize that GPT was used as a supplementary tool, similar to a search engine like Google or Microsoft Edge's Bing (which also features AI capabilities). The AI primarily acted as a tool for understanding technical details, much like referencing documentation websites or forums such as Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code implementation, model design, and conceptual ideas in this assignment are my own work. The AI tools served only to enhance my understanding and troubleshoot technical issues. The final code and results presented are fully my work, with GPT acting as a support tool for clarifying complex concepts and offering troubleshooting suggestions.\n"
